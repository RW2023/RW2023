# Greetings! 👋🏾

##  I am <strong>Ryan Wilson</strong>, a *junior* full-stack developer.

My current focus lies in *front-end development* 👀, and I am currently focused on honing my skills in this domain. I have a passion for these machines we have invented and I am dedicated to learning their language 🌱. I  continue to learn the latest industry standards and best practices, and I am always eager to expand my knowledge.

I am actively seeking opportunities to collaborate with like-minded students on projects that can help me grow both personally and professionally 💞️. If you'd like to get in touch, please don't hesitate to reach out to me through this platform 📫.
